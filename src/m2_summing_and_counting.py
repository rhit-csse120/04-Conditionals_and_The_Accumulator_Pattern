This module lets you practice the ACCUMULATOR pattern in classic forms:
   SUMMING:    total = total + number
   COUNTING:   count = count + 1

A subsequent module lets you practice the ACCUMULATOR pattern
in another classic form:
   IN GRAPHICS:   x = x + pixels

# TODO: 2. Read the following, then change its _TODO_ to DONE.
#   Throughout these exercises, you must use  RANGE  statements.
#   At this point of the course, you are restricted to the SINGLE-ARGUMENT
#   form of RANGE statements, like this:
#         range(blah):
#   There is a MULTIPLE-ARGUMENT form of RANGE statements (e.g. range(a, b))
#   but you are NOT permitted to use the MULTIPLE-ARGUMENT form yet, for
