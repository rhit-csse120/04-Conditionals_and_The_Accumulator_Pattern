This module demonstrates the ACCUMULATOR pattern in three classic forms:
   SUMMING:       total = total + number
   COUNTING:      count = count + 1
   IN GRAPHICS:   x = x + pixels

    # The example below shows one way to solve problems using
    #   HELPER variables (aka AUXILIARY variables)
    # In this approach:
    #  1. You determine all the variables that you need
    #       to construct/draw whatever the problem calls for.
    #       We call these HELPER variables.
    #  2. You initialize them BEFORE the loop, choosing values that
    #       make them just right for constructing and drawing the
    #       FIRST object to be drawn, in the FIRST time through the loop.
    #       For example,   x = starting_point.x   in the example below.
    #  3. You determine how many times the loop should run
    #       (generally, however many objects you want to draw)
    #       and write the FOR statement for the loop.
    #       For example,    for _ in range(n):  in the example below.
    #  4. Inside the loop you write the statements to construct and
    #       draw the FIRST object to be drawn, using your helper
    #       variables.  This is easy because you chose just the right
    #       values for those helper variables for this FIRST object.
    #  5. Test: Make sure the FIRST object appears.
    #       (It will be redrawn many times, that is OK).
    #  6. Add code at the BOTTOM of the loop that changes the helper
    #       variables appropriately for the NEXT time through the loop.
    #       For example,   x = x + diameter   in the example below.
    #  7. Test and fix as needed.

    # error-prone that using the loop variable to do all the work.
