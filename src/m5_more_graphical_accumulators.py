This module lets you practice one form of the ACCUMULATOR pattern,
namely, the "IN GRAPHICS" form which features:
  -- DRAWING OBJECTS via ACCUMULATING positions and/or sizes,
     as in:   x = x + pixels

Additionally, it emphasizes that you must
  ** DO A CONCRETE EXAMPLE BY HAND **
before you can implement a solution to the problem in Python.

# Students: As you work each of these problems, ask yourself:

#      If so, HOW MANY LOOPS?
#
#   2. Where I need a loop, what needs to happen:
#        -- BEFORE the loop?

#   Throughout these exercises, you must use  RANGE  statements.
#   At this point of the course, you are restricted to the SINGLE-ARGUMENT
#   form of RANGE statements, like this:
